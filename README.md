# MVPA MEG Tutorial

[work in progress]

This tutorial accompanies the preprint titled "Multivariate pattern analysis for MEG: a comprehensive comparison of dissimilarity measures", which is available at [placeholder](http://doi.org/).

## Python tutorial

### Preparation
The custom code for this tutorial can be downloaded as a zip file from [placeholder](https://github.com/m-guggenmos/megmvpa/tutorial_python.zip). This zip file includes the example dataset used for this tutorial. To reduce computational costs for the tutorial, the dataset is for one participant only and includes only 10 of 92 experimental conditions.
In addition, the zip file contains the following python files underlying the tutorial: 

File | Description
--- | --- 
cv.py | _containing code for pseudo-trials/permutations/cross-validation_


The tutorial requires 4 additional python packages, which should be available/pre-installed in most scientific python distributions: 
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
