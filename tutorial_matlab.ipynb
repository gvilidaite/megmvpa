    "This tutorial accompanies the preprint titled \"Multivariate pattern analysis for MEG: a comprehensive comparison of dissimilarity measures\", which is available at [placeholder](http://doi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this initial tutorial, we will cover SVM classification and show how to obtain 1) classification accuracy time courses, 2) representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), and 3) compute the intersession-reliability for RDMs.\n",

    "The custom code for this tutorial can be downloaded as a zip file from [placeholder](https://github.com/m-guggenmos/megmvpa/blob/master/example.ipynb). This zip file includes the example dataset used for this tutorial, which can be separately downloaded from [placeholder](https://github.com/m-guggenmos/megmvpa/blob/master/example.ipynb). To reduce computational costs for the tutorial, the dataset is for one participant only and includes only 10 of 92 experimental conditions.\n",

    "The Weighted Robust Distance classifier (WeiRD), one of the classifiers highlighted in the manuscript, is likewise included in the zip file (weird.py). If you're only interested in WeiRD or interested in the Matlab version, see [here](https://github.com/m-guggenmos/weird)."
