    "In this initial tutorial, we will cover SVM classification and show how to obtain 1) classification accuracy time courses, 2) representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), and 3) compute the intersession-reliability for RDMs.\n",

    "The custom code for this tutorial can be downloaded as a zip file from [placeholder](https://github.com/m-guggenmos/megmvpa/blob/master/example.ipynb). This zip file includes the example dataset used for this tutorial, which can be separately downloaded from [placeholder](https://github.com/m-guggenmos/megmvpa/blob/master/example.ipynb). To reduce computational costs for the tutorial, the dataset is for one participant only and includes only 10 of 92 experimental conditions.\n",
